# html_registration_form

Create all html elements. As you haven't learned yet how to use css to make the form look nice, don't worry about how your registration form looks for now.

Your HTML should contain the following tags:

- <input> with these values in the "type" attribute:
- text
- password
- date
- radio
- submit
- <textarea>
- <select>
